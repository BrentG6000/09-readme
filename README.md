# 09-readme

## Description

This command line app helps create README.md files. It solves the problem of having to keep a template for README files and instead automates the process. While creating this program
I used npm and node. I also used the node modules fs and inquirer.

## Installation

To install this app, simply download the files and run it through a CLI. Before starting the program, make sure to run npm i in the directory to install the needed node dependencies.
To start the app, run node index in the CLI. The program will then give you a series of questions about your app. Once all the questions are answered, an example README file named README2.md
will be created using the information you gave in your answers. Besides having the appropriate sections, the README that is created will also include a functioning table of contents
and a badge for the license used.
